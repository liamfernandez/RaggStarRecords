# No Label? No Problem: How to Build a Fanbase as an Independent Artist

![Artist jumping into crowd backwards trying to crowd surf]({'/blog_image1.png'})



Introduction

Hello and welcome to RaggStar! This free resource is for creatives that are committed to growing themselves as artists and entrepreneurs. We created this resource because we wish someone sat us down and shared this information with us when we first started our music careers. Being an independent artist can be equated to a small business owner starting their venture. There is no help, no capital backing, and no formal education that ever outlines the steps and processes that it takes for artists to succeed in the modern world. Our belief is that education can bridge the gap between the conglomerate of major labels that make up the music industry and the everyday aspiring artist who dreams of a vision bigger than themselves. The mission here is to to give you a knowledge base and step-by-step guides for building a successful music career in the 21st century. In a world where everyone is in it for themselves, we want to be the one resource that invests everything we have to offer back into you - The Artist.

Laying Down The Basics
Finding Your Sound/People

First things first, let us discuss the fundamentals. Behind every great artist is a great production team. The producer‚Äôs job is to help find their artists sound and hone in on that uniqueness. Your sound is your brand. Your particular sound will attract a particular fanbase. For example, Lil Baby came up in the Rap game as a street/trap rapper. His initial fanbase consisted of mainly young black people in the inner city of Atlanta. Then as he got bigger and bigger his fanbase slowly expanded to different demographics. Another good example is Peso Pluma, he is a hot new buzzing artist that has taken off in the last year. He ushered in a new genre coined Corridos Tumbados. This is a modern take on the ‚Äúcorridos‚Äù genre, which are Mexican narrative songs, or ballads, that often recount a heroic struggle. This style of music first became popular with the  people of Guadalajara, a city in Western-Central Mexico. From there the fans carried over into the mainstream. Essentially, between these big names that you see today, they all have core fanbases. Fanbases that are going to stick with them through thick and thin. They will buy their merch, their concert tickets, and will always listen to their music no matter how experimental they get. All of the other fans may come and go in waves but these guys will stick with you till the end. These ‚Äúcore fanbases‚Äù are what we are going to teach you how to build.

Step #1 is finding your sound. This is going to be the most crucial and typically the hardest for artists just starting out. What you need to do in order to find your sound is record, record, RECORD! We cannot emphasize how important this is. We have worked with hundreds of artists over 4 years. We see a lot of them give up wayyy too fast because they can‚Äôt quite find the sound they are looking for, get frustrated, then quit üôÅ. On the other hand we see artists that may come back to us after 2+ years of recording without putting a single song out just to find the sound they feel comfortable with. In the recording world, we call this ‚Äúfinding your pocket‚Äù or finding your niche. You will need to experiment with yourself in order to find out these key 5 characteristics about your artistry.

What type of beats do you record over?
What is the message you deliver in your songs?
What kind of cadence or ‚Äúflow‚Äù do you use?
What genre of music do you fall under?
Who are you in your music? Who is the character you're portraying?

The biggest issue I see with new artists when they first start recording is their confidence level. Now just like anything else, the skill of being a recording artist comes with time. Confidence is key when recording ANYTHING. You can‚Äôt hide from the mic. Your music is a portrayal of you. An embodiment of what you stand for. That is why so many listeners and fans feel like they know an artist through their music, even though they have never met them in real life. Because their confidence and message is so clear and concise they make the listener resonate with them. Feelings, emotions, and perspective are being translated through a 3-minute waveform.
